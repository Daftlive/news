# React Native News App

**This project has been done using React Native and Typescript.** 

The app is a news reader that uses [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) as a data source to display the news.

Different sources can be selected, either by country and category.

News is automatically saved on the device to avoid unnecessary calls to the api. The news refresh rate can be configured, which means how often the application should query the api.
